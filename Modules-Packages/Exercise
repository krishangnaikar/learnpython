Using Modules Lab

Create a new Python script called math_example.py.
Import the math module.
Use the math module to calculate the square root of 16 and print the result.
Import the random module.
Use the random module to generate a random number between 1 and 10 and print the result.
Save the script and run it.

Creating Modules Lab

Create a new Python file called greetings.py.
Define a function called say_hello(name) that takes a name parameter and prints a greeting message.


def say_hello(name): 
  print("Hello, " + name + "!")
  
Define a variable called pi that stores the value of pi (3.14159).


pi = 3.14159

Save the greetings.py file.
Create a new Python script called use_greetings.py.
Import the greetings module.
Use the say_hello() function to greet a user by name.
Print the value of the pi variable.
Save the use_greetings.py file and run it.

Creating Packages Lab

Create a new directory called my_package.
Add an __init__.py file to the my_package directory.
Create a new Python file called shapes.py in the my_package directory.

Define a function called calculate_area(shape, **kwargs) that takes a shape parameter (a string indicating the shape to calculate the area of) and any number of keyword arguments (depending on the shape). The function should return the area of the shape.

def calculate_area(shape, **kwargs): 
  if shape == "rectangle": 
    return kwargs['length'] * kwargs['width'] 
  elif shape == "circle": 
    return 3.14 * kwargs['radius'] ** 2
    
Save the shapes.py file.
Create a new Python script called use_shapes.py.
Import the my_package package.
Use the calculate_area() function to calculate the area of a rectangle with a length of 5 and a width of 10.
Use the calculate_area() function to calculate the area of a circle with a radius of 3.
Save the use_shapes.py file and run it.

Conclusion
By completing these labs, you should have a better understanding of how to use and create modules and packages in Python. These concepts are essential for organizing and reusing code, and can save you time and effort in developing new programs.
